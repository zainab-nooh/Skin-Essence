            <h2>Summary of work on Skin Essence</h2>
            <p>In our group project, we created a website about self care that gives people the access to look for skin care tips based on their skin type, tips and recommendations on how to be good at your skin care, and shopping products from our website.
                The design of our Home page works on providing an accessible transparency of surfing to the pages that would give them access to view tips, recommendations, services for shopping, the story of our website, and the making of the website.
            </p>
            <p>We included a “Skin-Types” page that shows all skin types, how to know your skin type, product recommendations, and access to other pages of the website that serve to take action from the learning outcomes of the page.</p>
            <p>We included a “Self-Care” page that highlights simple acts to perform which will make huge differences on the skin, suggests different types of general products and their use and impacts on skin, and a button that gets users to the product collections we offer.</p>    
            <p>We included an “Essence Collection” page that displays our product lists, small description, Pricing and ratings to them. As well as adding a search bar and categories that will simplify and get a better view of our collection of products.</p>

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>We have faced a few challenges through working on the website as any project might face. One of the biggest challenges we have faced is that the pages and their content must be adjustable for all screen sizes to be responsive. The effort of making that on the whole 6 pages was magnificent. Also, we faced a little issue in making divisions compatible with each other and useful in having similar and relatable layouts.</p>
            <p>We solved all of the challenges by having group meetings and making clear decisions on how to solve each problem with the group leader and members of the group.</p>

            <h2>Lessons from Group work</h2>
            <p>Working on this project was really beneficial to each one of us; as we learnt on how to  work all together, deal with errors in coding, working on the same line to get to the demanded result we aimed for and how to make the experience be more enjoyable and successful. Furthermore, working as a group always reminded us to keep being optimistic  and to show support for each other.</p>

            <h2>Lessons from Technical work</h2>
            <p>Throughout the whole process of working on this project, we learned how to utilize what we learned in the course in a professional structure from JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. All of that has improved us as we progress more.</p>
            <p>JavaScript helped us and made interactions between the website and our users. Besides that, HTML had a crucial role in making the structure of the websites and its elements. CSS was a core in making neat designs and good layouts from all aspects, spacing, sizing, ordering elements, and adding colors and fonts to create an appealing design for the website. Moreover, we had a great experience learning how to apply color and contrast to the website and to be more creative in applying ideas from scratch that might be impossible. Lastly, the whole journey we’ve been through encouraged us to be more ambitious and go beyond expectations.</p>
